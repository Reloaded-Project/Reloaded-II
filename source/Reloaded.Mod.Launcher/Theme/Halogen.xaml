    <!-- 
        This is an example of a more advanced theme. 
    
        Due to technical reasons; mainly involving the use of "Animations" and "Storyboards" all of the control "styles" have to be re-imported.
    
        This is a rather complicated process; especially to those who may be unfamiliar with WPF (the UI technology used by Reloaded).
        In this theme, we achieved this by copying the source files from the default theme and adjusting the paths of any SharedResourceDictionaries 
        inside the files to our own custom modified ones.
    
        Feel free to use this theme as a base for your own.
        PS. No guarantees stuff wouldn't break after updates.

        <!-- 
            Note: You can technically import just Controls.xaml, since that imports Styles which imports Colours.
                  However, we are importing all files in case of future internal changes.

        == Updates ==

        Mod Loader Version: 1.7.0
        Reloaded.WPF.Theme.Default: 3.0.4
        
        In case you ever feel like re-pasting the contents of Controls.xaml and Styles.xaml to account for new controls etc.
    
        == Note ==
        This theme is a tribute to the folks back at halogenOS (XOS).
        I haven't been around the Android community for years but I want to say hello again sometime soon.
        I've grown to be a big boy now hehehe.
