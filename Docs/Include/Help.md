The official downloads for Reloaded-II are on

### Reloaded doesn't boot, what should I do?

Before running Reloaded you should download all of the requirements listed.

**Used by the mod loader:**
- .NET Core 3.1 x64: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.2-windows-x64-installer
- .NET Core 3.1 x86: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.2-windows-x86-installer

**Used by the launcher:**
- .NET 5 x64: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-5.0.0-preview.8-windows-x64-installer

**And also (although most likely you will already have this):**
- Visual C++ Redist 2015/17/19 x64: https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x64.exe
- Visual C++ Redist 2015/17/19 x86: https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x86.exe

This is specified on the download page.
**You should install ALL of these**.

I apologise for the inconvenience, it has to be this way due to technical issues involved.
