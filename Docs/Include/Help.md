This is just a basic tiny document provided in case you get stuck 😊.

### What are the official download links for Reloaded?

The official downloads for Reloaded-II are on
- *Github* https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/releases

Anything else is unofficial.

Github is always kept up to date while Gamebanana is sometimes updated slightly less periodically. Regardless of what you download, the launcher will always offer to update itself to the latest up to date version.

Complete documentation for Reloaded is available on Github: https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II#reloaded-for-end-users.

### Reloaded doesn't boot, what should I do?

Before running Reloaded you should download all of the requirements listed.

**Used by the mod loader:**
- .NET Core 3.1 x64: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.2-windows-x64-installer
- .NET Core 3.1 x86: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.2-windows-x86-installer

**Used by the launcher:**
- .NET 5 x64: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-5.0.0-preview.8-windows-x64-installer

**And also (although most likely you will already have this):**
- Visual C++ Redist 2015/17/19 x64: https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x64.exe
- Visual C++ Redist 2015/17/19 x86: https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/VC_redist.x86.exe

This is specified on the download page.
**You should install ALL of these**.

I apologise for the inconvenience, it has to be this way due to technical issues involved.
