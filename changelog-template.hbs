# 1.30.0: Sliders and Supported Games

# Added `TickFrequencyDouble` to `SliderControlParamsAttribute`

The `TickFrequency` property on `SliderControlParamsAttribute` was previously an `int`, which prevented
using non-integer tick frequencies for sliders (e.g., `0.5`).

A new `TickFrequencyDouble` property has been added. When set, it takes precedence over the old `TickFrequency` property.

```csharp
// Old way (integer only, now obsolete)
[SliderControlParams(minimum: 0, maximum: 1, tickFrequency: 1)]

// New way (supports non-integer values)
[SliderControlParams(minimum: 0, maximum: 1, TickFrequencyDouble = 0.1)]
```

Alongside the addition of  `textFieldFormat` from @monkeyman192 which (somehow) sat unreleased for 2 years, due to missing `Reloaded.Mod.Interfaces` release, you can now have sliders with nice fractions in configs, without crazy behaviour.

A real example where this could be useful could look like this:

Making the HUD arbitrarily wide on widescreen displays.

The old `TickFrequency` property has been marked as `[Obsolete]` but remains functional for backwards compatibility.

## Warn When Installing Mods Without Supported Games

When installing mods via drag-and-drop, download, or the `r2:` protocol, Reloaded-II now checks if the mod
has any supported applications configured. If none are found, a dialog will prompt you to select which
game(s) the mod should be enabled for.

- Selecting **Yes** opens the mod edit dialog to configure supported applications
- Selecting **No** keeps the mod installed without changes (you can configure it later)

This helps prevent the occasional issue where a mod author forgot to mark a mod as compatible with any game.
Without an associated game, the mod wouldn't appear in any game's mod list, which could leave users confused.
