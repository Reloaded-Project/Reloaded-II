[Previous Changelog](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/releases/tag/1.29.2).

Just a few low effort fixes and miscellany. As usual, Reloaded-II is on life support while I spend
the next years building the next best thing - if you want features, please contribute!

# vNext: Miscellaneous Improvements

No update to .NET 10 as of current.

According to 3rd party reports I got thus far, `Proton` needs updating to receive some upstream fixes from `Wine` for .NET 10, which may take a while.

## Added Progress Bar for Mod Installation

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f09ccad-f036-4856-806c-3c75f281307a)

If a mod takes longer than 3 seconds to install via Drag & Drop, a simple progress bar will display on the screen now.
In practice you should only see this if you install large mods (think >500MB); on a typical CPU.

## Save Mod Config on Publish, Including `IncludeFiles` and `ExcludeFiles` by @TheBestAstroNOT , @Sewer56

When you `Publish` a mod you have an option to exclude certain files from the released project via `File Inclusions & Exclusions`.
By default, that is all `.json` files except `.deps.json` and `.runtimeconfig.json` ones.

Previously, changes on this menu didn't save; as barely anyone ever changed the defaults.
Now they do.
