[Previous Changelog](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/releases/tag/1.29.3).

Just a few community PRs and miscellany. As usual, Reloaded-II is on life support while I spend
the next years building the next best thing - if you want features, please contribute!

# 1.29.5: Add missing `ModConfig.json` to include files

There was a small regression in `1.29.3`, where the default includes did not
include `ModConfig.json`, that's now been fixed.

In addition I added a missing 'include files' label before the second table.

# 1.29.4: Misc Linux Installer Improvements

Small improvements to install on Linux:

- [Ensure 'Applications' directory exists so creating shortcut doesn't fail during install on some systems.](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/issues/717)
- Create `Software\Wine` key in registry if doesn't exist. May fix odd cases where people's 'show dot files' settings don't enable by default. 

And also:
- Updated 🇫🇷 French Localization by @dysfunctionalriot

# 1.29.3: More Miscellaneous Improvements

## Allow .NET 9 Versions >= 9.0.8 for loader.

No update to .NET 10 as of current; but am allowing 9.0.8 or greater for loader now.

According to 3rd party reports I got thus far, `Proton` needs updating to receive some upstream fixes from `Wine` for .NET 10, which may take a while to reach downstream.
We wait for Proton 11, I suppose.

## Added Progress Bar for Mod Installation

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f09ccad-f036-4856-806c-3c75f281307a)

If a mod takes longer than 3 seconds to install via Drag & Drop, a simple progress bar will display on the screen now.
In practice you should only see this if you install large mods (think >500MB); on a typical CPU.

## Save Mod Config on Publish, Including `IncludeFiles` and `ExcludeFiles` by @TheBestAstroNOT , @Sewer56

When you `Publish` a mod you have an option to exclude certain files from the released project via `File Inclusions & Exclusions`.
By default, that is all `.json` files except `.deps.json` and `.runtimeconfig.json` ones.

Previously, changes on this menu didn't save; as barely anyone ever changed the defaults.
Now they do.

## Reorder ASI Loader DLL Detection Order by @dreamsyntax

The order of which DLL name gets selected for Ultimate ASI Loader was changed.
Now matches using order defined in our code, rather than the order in `PE Header`.

With that in mind, items were rearranged to be as least intrusive as possible.
For instance, ASI Loader as `dinput8.dll` has caused issues in the past in limited scenarios; e.g. when using C# library with SharpDX to read inputs via dinput.

## Disabled CET

[.NET 9 added a security feature (on by default)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/interop/9.0/cet-support) which is incompatible with older unsupported versions of Windows.
Namely Windows 10 22H2 and older.

Given that Reloaded-II is already unsafe by design (injects arbitrary code), and it's usually not used for multiplayer, there is no good reason for CET to be enforced.
Rather, it should be the game's responsibility to opt in. Generally, if possible, if the base game runs on the PC, the modded game should too, out of the box.
