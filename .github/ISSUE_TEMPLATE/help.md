**Describe the Issue**
A clear and concise description of what you would like help with.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Additional Resources**
If the issue is related to any external resource e.g. specific version of a mod or pack, consider stating the version or linking the resource in question. Preferably though, mod specific issues should go in their own GitHub repositories as I in most cases would not be able to help.
